print (f"{female_name} was being chased down the street by two {adj1} {plural_noun}. She was starting to get out of breath so she decided to {verb1} a {noun1}. \
Somehow, that worked! They stopped chasing her. But now she had an even bigger \
problem. Out of nowhere, a {colour} {adj2} {animal} appeared. She saw a {noun2} near her and hit the {animal} in the {body_part}. But that did not work.\
The {animal} started to {verb2} so {female_name} had to {verb2} too! What a wierd story.")
